üöÄ Setup & Deployment
This application is designed for simplicity. It's a single index.html file that can be deployed anywhere without a complex build process.

1. Create a Firebase Project
Before you can run the app, you need a free Firebase project to handle your database and authentication.

Go to the Firebase Console and create a new project.

Add a Web App to your project.

Copy the firebaseConfig object that it provides you.

Navigate to the Authentication section, go to the Sign-in method tab, and enable Google as a provider.

Navigate to the Firestore Database section and create a database, starting in test mode.

Go to the Rules tab in Firestore and replace the default rules with:

rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /user-workouts/{userId}/{document=**} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
  }
}

2. Configure the Code
Open the index.html file.

Find the firebaseConfig object at the top of the <script type="text/babel"> tag.

Paste your own firebaseConfig object that you copied from your Firebase project.

3. Deploy
The easiest way to get this live is with a service like Netlify Drop or GitHub Pages.

For Netlify: Simply drag and drop your index.html file onto the Netlify Drop page.

For GitHub Pages: Push the index.html file to a public GitHub repository and enable GitHub Pages in the repository's settings.
